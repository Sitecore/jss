# For development purposes, note Next.js supports a .env.local 
# file, which is already configured to be git ignored.
# Read more about Next.js support of environment variables here:

# The public URL to use for absolute URLs, which are required when
# the Next.js app is run within the Sitecore Experience Editor.
# This should match the `serverSideRenderingEngineApplicationUrl`
# in your Sitecore configuration (see \sitecore\config\JssNextWeb.config).
# Be sure to update these values accordingly as your public endpoint changes.
# See https://jss.sitecore.com/docs/fundamentals/services/view-engine
PUBLIC_URL=http://localhost:3000

# To secure the Experience Editor endpoint exposed by your Next.js app
# (`/api/editing/render` by default), a secret token is used. This (client-side)
# value must match your server-side value (see \sitecore\config\JssNextWeb.config).
# We recommend an alphanumeric value of at least 16 characters.
