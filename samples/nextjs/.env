# For development purposes, note Next.js supports a .env.local

# The public URL to use for absolute URLs, which are required when
# the Next.js app is run within the Sitecore Experience Editor.
# This should match the `serverSideRenderingEngineApplicationUrl`
# in your Sitecore configuration (see \sitecore\config\JssNextWeb.config).
# Be sure to update these values accordingly as your public endpoint changes.
# See https://jss.sitecore.com/docs/fundamentals/services/view-engine

# To secure the Experience Editor endpoint exposed by your Next.js app
# (`/api/editing/render` by default), a secret token is used. This (client-side)
# value must match your server-side value (see \sitecore\config\JssNextWeb.config).
# We recommend an alphanumeric value of at least 16 characters.

# Your Sitecore API key is needed to build the app. Typically, the API key is
# defined in `scjssconfig.json` (as `sitecore.apiKey`). This file may not exist
# when building locally (if you've never run `jss setup`), or when building in a
# higher environment (since `scjssconfig.json` is ignored from source control).
# In this case, use this environment variable to provide the value at build time.

# Your Sitecore API hostname is needed to build the app. Typically, the API host is

# Sitecore JSS npm packages utilize the debug module for debug logging.
# https://www.npmjs.com/package/debug
# Set the DEBUG environment variable to 'sitecore-jss:*' to see all logs:
#DEBUG=sitecore-jss:*
# Or be selective and show for example only layout service logs:
#DEBUG=sitecore-jss:layout
# Or everything BUT layout service logs:
#DEBUG=sitecore-jss:*,-sitecore-jss:layout
