## Important Notes
* Even if you use Static HTML / `next export`, you must run a Next.js instance which is accessible to your Content Management role in order to [use the Experience Editor](/docs/nextjs/experience-editor/walkthrough).
* The _Headless SSR Proxy_ is neither needed for, nor compatible with, Next.js-based JSS applications.
* Production hosting of Next.js-based JSS applications in "integrated mode" is not supported.

## Deployment options

### Vercel
The creators of Next.js, Vercel, offer deployment and hosting solutions optimized for Next.js. They support all Next.js features out of the box, including incremental static site (re-)generation, hybrid rendering, and internationalization. Your application can be deployed directly from source control and will be optimized via Vercel's edge network and serverless functions.

* [Vercel deployment](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment#vercel-recommended) (_Next.js Documentation_)

### Node.js Server
Next.js can be deployed to any hosting provider or environment that supports Node.js.

* [Discussion on Next.js and Docker](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/16995) (_Next.js GitHub_)

### Static HTML Export
If you would like to deploy using a fully static HTML export, first ensure you are aware of the [limitations in supported Next.js features](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export#caveats) when using `next export`.

## Triggering Webhooks on Content Publish
When using `getStaticProps` with `getStaticPaths`, or deploying static HTML with `next export`, it is necessary to trigger a `next build` and site deployment when content is published. To facilitate this, the Headless Services module includes the ability to invoke a webhook following completion of Sitecore publishing. See the [Vercel deployment walkthrough](/docs/nextjs/deploying-to-production/vercel) for configuration details.
