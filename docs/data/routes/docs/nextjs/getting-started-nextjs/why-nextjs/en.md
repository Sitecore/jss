# Why Next.js and JSS?

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is a framework built on top of **React**. It aims to help developers create production-ready applications with minimal need for configuration and boilerplate code. 

The latest JSS SDK leverages many of Next.js' [features](https://nextjs.org/#features), to simplify and enhance development workflow and experience. 

## Improvements over previous JSS SDKs

* Development and production runtime parity, including SSR during development.
* Fewer confusing “modes” and deployment requirements.
* No Headless SSR Proxy needed for production or integration with Sitecore tracking.
* No need to deploy your application bundle to the Content Management instance for Experience Editor support.

## Features

- Support for Next.js static HTML export, incremental static site generation, server-side rendering, and hybrid rendering.
