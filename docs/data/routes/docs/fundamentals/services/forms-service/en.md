# Forms Service

To enable consuming [Sitecore Forms](https://doc.sitecore.com/users/101/sitecore-experience-platform/en/introducing-sitecore-forms.html) from JSS, APIs are provided to:

* Get form data from [Layout Service](/docs/fundamentals/services/layout-service) using a [Rendering Contents Resolver](/docs/techniques/extending-layout-service/layoutservice-rendering-contents)
* Accept form posts and return JSON data in a REST service. The URL for for this API is `/api/jss/formbuilder`

The usage and setup of the forms service are detailed in the [forms reference documentation](/docs/techniques/forms).
