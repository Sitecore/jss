# JSS Angular API

The `sitecore-jss-angular` package is a UI library that delivers components for rendering data from the Sitecore [Layout Service](/docs/fundamentals/services/layout-service).

# Getting started

> Note: Most users should use this library as part of the [Angular sample app](/docs/client-frameworks/angular/sample-app); these instructions are general and do not cover many aspects of configuration.

## Step 1: Install sitecore-jss-angular

You can use the `npm` command-line tool to install packages. Use whichever is appropriate for your project in the examples below.

```sh
npm install @sitecorelabs/sitecore-jss-angular
```

## Step 2: Import the JssModule

For this example we show how a `WelcomeComponent` is added to the list of components that can be rendered by a placeholder, by registering them with the `JssModule.withComponents()` method.

```ts
import { JssModule } from '@sitecorelabs/sitecore-jss-angular';
import { WelcomeComponent } from './components/welcome/welcome.component';

@NgModule({
  ...
  declarations: [
    WelcomeComponent,
    ...
  ],
  imports: [
    JssModule.withComponents([
      { name: 'Welcome', type: WelcomeComponent }
    ])
  ],
  ...
})
export class FooModule { }
```

> Note: in the Angular sample app, the `JssModule` is imported and dynamically generated by convention, with the components being registered based on their presence on disk at build time. This reduces maintenance of the component registrations, however it is also optional.

## Step 3: All setup and ready

The `sitecore-jss-angular` library is all setup and all the structural directives for field types as well as the placeholder component can now be used.

Check out the [sample app walkthrough](/docs/client-frameworks/angular/sample-app) to see usage of the library.

# Placeholder Directives

A component is provided by the library to help render [_placeholders_](/docs/fundamentals/understanding-layout) returned by Layout Service. The placeholder component dynamically instantiates additional Angular components within it based on the components defined in the Layout Service data.

Basic placeholder technique consists of passing it the `rendering` data injected into the component:

```
<sc-placeholder name="jss-styleguide-layout" [rendering]="rendering"></sc-placeholder>
```

Advanced usage is also possible, using templates to customize the markup emitted around each child component:

```
<div class="row" sc-placeholder name="jss-reuse-example" [rendering]="rendering">
  <ng-template renderEach let-rendering="rendering">
    <div class="col-sm">
      <sc-render-component [rendering]="rendering"></sc-render-component>
    </div>
  </ng-template>
  <ng-template renderEmpty let-renderings="renderings">
    <div class="col-sm">
      <sc-placeholder [renderings]="renderings"></sc-placeholder>
    </div>
  </ng-template>
  <ng-template scPlaceholderLoading>
    <img src="loading.gif">
  </ng-template>
</div>
```

> See the _layout reuse_ example in the sample app's styleguide for more details about advanced placeholder technique.

# Field Helper Directives

The library provides structural directives to help output Sitecore field values. The benefit of using structural directives are, as a developer, all features of a tag is available, and not wrapped inside another component. When running inside Experience Editor, a marked tag is replaced with another element for editing if the field is editable.

For example to enable editing on an image, do:

```html
<img *scImage="rendering.fields.logoImage" />
```

Here is a list of all supported structural directives, and how they are used (where `field` is data coming from a placeholder component):

## Text

### Example

```html
<p *scText="field; editable: true; encode: true"></p>
```

### Input Properties

| name | description |
|------|-------------|
| default / `scText` | The component or route field you wish to render. Usually of Sitecore type `Single-Line Text` or `Multi-Line Text` but can be used with numeric types as well. |
| `editable` | Indicates whether the experience editor / Sitecore-formatted HTML output should be used. (Default: `true`) |
| `encode` | Enables or disables HTML encoding of output value. A `false` value also implies `editable: false`. (Default: `true`)

> For `Multi-line Text`, the provided `editable` value will have any line breaks replaced by `<br />` already. If using the non-editable value, you can process `field.value` yourself to replace JSON newlines with the desired markup, or use a [CSS `white-space`](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_text_white-space.asp) value such as `pre-wrap`.

## RichText

### Example

```html
<div *scRichText="field; editable: true"></div>
```

### Input Properties

| name | description |
|------|-------------|
| default / `scRichText` | The component or route field you wish to render. Should be Sitecore type `Rich Text`. |
| `editable` | Indicates whether the experience editor / Sitecore-formatted HTML output should be used. (Default: `true`) |

## Image

### Example

```html
<img *scImage="field; editable: true" />
```

### Input Properties

| name | description |
|------|-------------|
| default / `scImage` | The component or route field you wish to render. Should be Sitecore type `Image`. |
| `editable` | Indicates whether the experience editor / Sitecore-formatted HTML output should be used. (Default: `true`) |
| `urlParams` | The [query string parameters](https://community.sitecore.net/technical_blogs/b/sitecorejohn_blog/posts/media-options-and-query-string-parameters-in-the-sitecore-asp-net-cms) that should be added to the image URL. Note that because JSS does not support security hashing of media URLs, these parameter sets will need to be white-listed on the server. |
| `attrs` | Key/value attribute values for the resulting image tag. Note that attributes added to the host element will also be passed through, but will not support data binding. |

> The `*scImage` directive gives special treatment to the `srcSet` attribute if provided via the `attrs` input property. You can provide an array of objects which represent query string parameters for each element of a `srcSet`. This enables responsive images with server-side rendering when combined with a `sizes` attribute.

## Link

### Example

```html
<a *scLink="field; editable: true"></a>
```

| name | description |
|------|-------------|
| default / `scLink` | The component or route field you wish to render. Should be Sitecore type `General Link`. |
| `editable` | Indicates whether the experience editor / Sitecore-formatted HTML output should be used. (Default: `true`) |
| `attrs` | Key/value attribute values for the resulting output tag. Note that attributes added to the host element will also be passed through, but will not support data binding. |

> If using `editable` output from Sitecore, `scLink` will create a wrapper `span` around the Sitecore-provided markup, and apply host element attributes and `attrs` to this `span`.

## File

### Example

```html
<a *scFile="field"></a>
```

### Input Properties

| name | description |
|------|-------------|
| default / `scFile` | The component or route field you wish to render. Should be Sitecore type `File`. |

> The `File` field does not support inline editing via the Experience Editor in Sitecore, but can be edited via the default field editor on components.
