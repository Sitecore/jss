# Using JSS with Angular

Sitecore JSS supports developing modern Angular applications with Sitecore.

## Sample Application

The [JSS CLI](/docs/getting-started/quick-start) can be used to quickly create an `angular-cli`-based JSS application:

```sh
jss create my-angular-jss-app angular
cd my-angular-jss-app
jss start
```

We recommend reading the [sample app walkthrough](/docs/client-frameworks/angular/sample-app) to understand the sample app, but it's also well commented if you'd rather read code.
