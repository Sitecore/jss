# Using JSS with Vue

Sitecore JSS supports developing modern Vue applications with Sitecore.

## Sample Application

The [JSS CLI](/docs/client-frameworks/getting-started/quick-start) can be used to quickly create a `@vue/cli`-based JSS application:

```sh
jss create my-vue-jss-app vue
cd my-vue-jss-app
jss start
```

We recommend reading the [sample app walkthrough](/docs/client-frameworks/vue/sample-app) to understand the sample app, but it's also well commented if you'd rather read code.

> The sample app was built using the [`@vue/cli` version 3](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) as a starting point. However, the `sitecore-jss-vue` package has no dependencies on `@vue/cli`.

## Tools

Using the [Vue DevTools](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-devtools) Chrome extension is highly recommended for troubleshooting Vue apps.

## Package Reference

[Reference material for the `sitecore-jss-vue` package](/docs/client-frameworks/vue/reference).
