Note: if you see any errors when opening your connected app, it may be because the cookies from the Sitecore instance are interfering. If you are logged into Sitecore in the regular browser, then it's best to open the local app in an incognito instance.

Enter whatever you’d like for Gender and Age Range on the next screen.

Clicking into the next screen will provide you with an experience personalized to your stated interest in Basketball.
