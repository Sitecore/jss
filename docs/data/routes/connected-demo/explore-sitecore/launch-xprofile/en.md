# Launch Experience Profile

The Experience Profile consists of a timeline and multiple tabs that display a summary of key experience analytics data for individual contacts. You can view one contact at a time.

An information area to the right continually displays a summary of the latest visit information and metrics associated with the contact.

The Latest Visit panel contains a link to the Visit Detail report, which displays detailed information about the contact’s latest visit.
