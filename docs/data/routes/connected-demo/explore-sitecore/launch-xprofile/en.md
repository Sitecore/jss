# Launch Experience Profile

The Experience Profile consists of a timeline and multiple tabs that display a summary of key experience analytics data for individual contacts. You can view one contact at a time.

An information area to the right continually displays a summary of the latest visit information and metrics associated with the contact.

The Latest Visit panel contains a link to the Visit Detail report, which displays detailed information about the contact's latest visit.

1. Access the Experience Profile from the Sitecore Launchpad by clicking on the Experience Profile button.
