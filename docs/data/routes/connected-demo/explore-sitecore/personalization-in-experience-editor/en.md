The first personalization rule relates to a specific campaign, which can only be accessed via a specific campaign code (Boston Marathon Campaign Code: sc_camp=C0D46075D0B249AD866092B5E525D639). The second is triggered when a contact's skill level in Basketball is greater than 6 â€“ this is the personalization rule that is triggered by moving the Basketball slider to "Expert."

Each version contains a mini-A/B test, one that will show you the Visits and Effect of each personalized version. **"Visits"** equals what percentage of people were shown the personalized version. **"Effect"** shows the increase/decrease in Engagement Value stemming from the personalized version.

Note that the personalization rules here only demonstrate a tiny portion of Sitecore's broad range of personalization options. The platform's mature rules engine can drive personalization based on business goals, IP information, profiling taxonomy, and other data.
