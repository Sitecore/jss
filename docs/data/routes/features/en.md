## Implement Sitecore Experience Platform apps using your favorite JavaScript framework

JSS supports multiple front-end frameworks to provide flexibility for developers.

### ![Development](/assets/img/features_icon_1.svg) Development

**JSS CLI**  
Sitecore JSS includes a handy Node-based command-line tool to make it easy to get started and maintain your application.

**Workflow**  
Code-first or Sitecore-first, choose the development workflow that suits your situation best.

**Application Integration**  
With a code-first approach, your app can be imported into Sitecore XP, and JSS will take care of the generation of all the necessary artifacts.

### ![Deployment](/assets/img/features_icon_2.svg) Deployment

**Cross Platform**  
Support for physically decoupled "headless" deployments. Deploy your app "headlessly" to any platform that runs server-side JavaScript.

**Ease of Deployment**  
Your web app is a nimble self-contained JS bundle, easier to deploy and manage.

**Scalability**  
Use CDN’s, proxies, and Node.js server to scale your applications.

### ![Services and Api’s](/assets/img/features_icon_3.svg) Services and Api’s

**GraphQL**  
Use GraphQL to query Sitecore and retrieve the data you need in the most efficient way.

**Server-side Rendering**  
JSS supports headless server-side rendering using any service that supports hosting Node.js applications.

**Translations**  
Sitecore JSS has been built to allow you to take advantage of one of Sitecore's strongest WCM features - content language versioning.

### ![Content management](/assets/img/features_icon_4.svg) Content management

**Content Creation & Advanced Editor**  
Use the Sitecore Experience Editor, a WYSIWYG editor that allows you to easily make changes to items directly on the page. You can edit all the items that are visible on the page — text, graphics, logos, links, and so on

**Workflow & Governance**  
To ensure that only items that have been approved are published, you can use workflows to formalize and enforce your company processes and procedures.

**Preview**  
The preview functionality lets you preview all your items on your website without publishing them first. Preview based on different dates, time, languages, and on multiple devices.

### ![Experience management](/assets/img/features_icon_5.svg) Experience management

**Analytics**  
Experience Analytics contains tools that let you view detailed reports about your website's visitors in real-time.

**Personalization**  
Use rules to deliver targeted, relevant content to your contacts based on their characteristics and behavior, such as location, gender, or previous visits. Ensure that the right content reaches the right contacts at the right time.

**Optimization**  
Use Experience Optimization to test content and presentation components within your website or app to ensure you use the most effective combinations.
