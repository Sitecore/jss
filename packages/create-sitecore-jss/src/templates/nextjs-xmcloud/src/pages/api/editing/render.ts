import { EditingRenderMiddleware } from '@sitecore-jss/sitecore-jss-nextjs/editing';

/**
 * This Next.js API route is used to handle GET and POST requests from Sitecore editors.
 * GET requests are used with Metadata editing mode while POST ones are used with Chromes(legacy) mode.
 * This route should match the `serverSideRenderingEngineEndpointUrl` in your Sitecore configuration,
 * which is set to "http://localhost:3000/api/editing/render" by default (see \sitecore\config\<%- appName %>.config).
 *
 * For Metadata mode, the `EditingRenderMiddleware` will
 *  1. Extract data about the route we need to rendr from the Sitecore editor GET request
 *  2. Enable Next.js Preview Mode, passing the route data as preview data
 *  3. Redirect the request to the route, passing along the Preview Mode cookies.
 *     This allows retrieval of the editing data in preview context (via an `EditingDataService`) - see `SitecorePagePropsFactory`
 *  4. The redirected request will render the page with editing markup in place
 * 
 * For Chromes(legacy) mode, the `EditingRenderMiddleware` will
 *  1. Extract editing data from the Sitecore editor POST request
 *  2. Stash this data (for later use in the page render request) via an `EditingDataService`, which returns a key for retrieval
 *  3. Enable Next.js Preview Mode, passing our stashed editing data key as preview data
 *  4. Invoke the actual page render request, passing along the Preview Mode cookies.
 *     This allows retrieval of the editing data in preview context (via an `EditingDataService`) - see `SitecorePagePropsFactory`
 *  5. Return the rendered page HTML to the Sitecore editor
 *

/**
 * [Chromes mode only] For Vercel deployments: 
 * if you experience crashes in editing, you may need to use VercelEditingDataCache or a custom Redis data cache implementation with EditingRenderMiddleware
 * Please refer to documentation for a detailed guide.
