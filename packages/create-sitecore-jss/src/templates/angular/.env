# Sitecore JSS npm packages utilize the debug module for debug logging.

# Set the DEBUG environment variable to 'sitecore-jss:*' to see all logs:
#DEBUG=sitecore-jss:*
# Or be selective and show for example only layout service logs:
#DEBUG=sitecore-jss:layout
# Or everything BUT layout service logs:
#DEBUG=sitecore-jss:*,-sitecore-jss:layout
