<div data-e2e-id="graphql-layout">
  <ng-container *ngIf="disconnectedMode">
    <p>
      This app is running in disconnected mode. GraphQL requires connected mode, headless
      connected mode, or integrated mode to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Libraries such as <code>graphql-tools</code> can provide GraphQL API mocking
      capabilities, which could enable disconnected GraphQL. This is not supported out of the
      box, however.
    </p>
    <p>
      To view the GraphQL samples, restart the app using <code>jss start:connected</code>&nbsp;
      or deploy the app to Sitecore to run in integrated mode per the JSS documentation.
    </p>
