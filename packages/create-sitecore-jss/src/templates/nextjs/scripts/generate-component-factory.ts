/*
  COMPONENT FACTORY GENERATION
  Generates the `/src/temp/componentFactory.ts` file, which maps JSS React components
  to Sitecore renderings.

  The component factory is a mapping between a string name and a React component instance.
  When the Sitecore Layout service returns a layout definition, it returns named components.
  This mapping is used to construct the component hierarchy for the layout.

  Generating the componentFactory is optional, and it can be maintained manually if preferred.

  The default convention uses the component's filename (without the extension) as the component
  name. For example, the file `/components/ComponentName.ts` would map to component `ComponentName`.
  This can be customized in writeComponentFactory().

  This script supports two modes. In default mode, the component factory file is written once.
  In watch mode, the component factory source folder is watched, and componentFactory.ts is
  regenerated whenever files are added or deleted. Run in watch mode by passing a `--watch` argument
  when calling the script.
