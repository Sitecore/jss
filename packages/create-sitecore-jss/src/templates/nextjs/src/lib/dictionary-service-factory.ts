            GraphQL endpoint may reach its rate limit with the amount of Layout and Dictionary requests it receives and throw a rate limit error.
            GraphQL Dictionary and Layout Services can handle rate limit errors from server and attempt a retry on requests.
            For this, specify the number of retries the GraphQL client will attempt. 
            It will only try the request once by default.
            retries: 'number'
            Additionally, you have the flexibility to customize the retry strategy by passing your customized RetryStrategy
            object using the DefaultRetryStrategy class. The DefaultRetryStrategy class, which can be imported from the @sitecore-jss-nextjs
            package, provides two essential methods: 'shouldRetry' which returns a boolean indicating whether a retry should
            be attempted, and 'getDelay' which calculates the delay (in milliseconds) before the subsequent retry based on
            the encountered error and the current attempt.
            Example:
            retryStrategy: new DefaultRetryStrategy({
              statusCodes: 'number[]',
              factor: 'number' (The exponential factor to calculate backoff-time),
            }),
          */

            (process.env.GRAPH_QL_SERVICE_RETRIES &&
              parseInt(process.env.GRAPH_QL_SERVICE_RETRIES, 10)) ||
            0,
        })

          apiHost: config.sitecoreApiHost,
          apiKey: config.sitecoreApiKey,
          siteName,
        });
