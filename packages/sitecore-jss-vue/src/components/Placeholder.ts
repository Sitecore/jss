// Using `ThisTypedComponentOptionsWithRecordProps` seems to be a bit
// unconventional in the Vue/TS realm. However, after using the two
// "recommended" approaches - Vue.extend() or class decorators
// via `vue-class-component` and `vue-property-decorator` - as well as
// some experimentation with the VueConstructor type, this was the only
// way I found to compile AND generate sensible typings.

// Using Vue.extend() somewhat worked, but the compiler didn't like
// the use of properties defined in the `inject` property, e.g.
// `this.injectedComponentFactory`. The error was that the property
// doesn't exist on the type returned by Vue.extend(), `CombinedVueInstance`.
// There's probably an easy way around that, but I tried several
// different approaches but couldn't find the winning declaration.
// This approach in particular was promising: export const Placeholder = (Vue as VueConstructor<Vue>).extend()
// But the generated typings seemed wrong, similar to the typings mentioned
// in the next paragraph.

// Using the class/prop decorators from the libraries mentioned above
// resulted in typings that included non-"prop" properties like
// the `data` properties, `methods` and the `render` function.
// None of which seem particularly relevant to consumers, but I could be wrong about that.
// However, the biggest issue was that using the decorators also changed the compiled code
// and actually _broke_ usage of `this.$jss` in instance methods.
// I didn't dig too deeply into why, but I suspect it's because
// the compiled code attaches methods to the `Placeholder` prototype.
// And `this` within the prototype only referenced a Vue instance,
// but not the global Vue instance that had plugin properties defined.
// Other plugin properties besides `$jss` were also "missing",
// e.g. $router, $apollo
